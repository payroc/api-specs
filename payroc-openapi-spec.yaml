                    - `true` - Run a sale and automatically capture the transaction.
                    - `false`- Run a pre-authorization and capture the transaction later.  

                    **Note**: If you send `false` and the terminal doesn't support pre-authorization, we set the transaction's status to pending. The merchant must capture the transaction to take payment from the customer.

                    **Note**: If the value for **processAsSale** is `true`, the gateway ignores the value in **autoCapture**.
