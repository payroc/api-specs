      Create an event subscription so that we notify you when certain events occur, for example, when we change the status of a processing account.  
      When you subscribe to an event, provide the following information:  
        - **Event type** - The events that we should notify you about. You can subscribe to more than one event within the same request. For a list of events that you can subscribe to, go to [Events](https://docs.payroc.com/knowledge/basic-concepts/events).  
        - **Notification method** - The endpoint that we send a notification to if an event occurs. We send notifications by webhook request.  
        - **Event status** - The status of the event subscription.  
        - **Support email address** - Email address that we contact if we can't deliver notifications.  
      <br/>  
      Use our event subscriptions endpoint to do the following:  
      - [**Create event subscription**](#createEventSubscription) - Subscribe to receive notifications when events occur.  
      - [**Update event subscription**](#updateEventSubscription) - Change the details of an event subscription, for example, to receive notifications for an additional event.  
      - [**Partially update an event subscription**](#patchEventSubscription) - Change values of an existing event subscription.  
      - [**Retrieve an event subscription**](#getEventSubscription) - Retrieve all the information that we stored in an event subscription.

      summary: Partially update pricing intent
      description: |
        Use this method to partially update a pricing intent. Structure your request to follow the [RFC 6902](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) standard.  

        If you update a pricing intent, it won't affect merchants you've previously onboarded.  

        To update a pricing intent, you need its pricingIntentId. Our gateway returned the pricingIntentId in the response of the [Create Pricing Intent](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/pricing-intents/create) method.  

        **Note:** If you don't have the pricingIntentId, use our [List Pricing Intents](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/pricing-intents/list) method to search for the pricing intent.  

        You can update the following details about a pricing intent:  

        - Fees, including the base fees, processor fees, and gateway fees.  
        - Custom name for the pricing intent.  
        - Additional services that merchants can sign up for.

        Use this method to delete a pricing intent.  

        > **Important:** When you delete a pricing intent, you can't recover it. You also won't be able to assign the pricing intent to a merchant's boarding application.  

        To delete a pricing intent, you need its pricingIntentId. Our gateway returned the pricingIntentId in the response of the [Create Pricing Intent](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/pricing-intents/create) method.  

        **Note:** If you don't have the pricingIntentId, use our [List Pricing Intents](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/pricing-intents/list) method to search for the pricing intent.

      description: |
        Use this method to retrieve a [paginated](https://docs.payroc.com/api/pagination) list of payment links linked to a processing terminal.  

        **Note:** If you want to view a specific payment link and you have its paymentLinkId, use our [Retrieve Payment Link](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/payment-links/retrieve) method.  

        Use query parameters to filter the list of results that we return, for example, to search for only active links or multi-use links.  

        Our gateway returns the following information about each payment link in the list:  
        - **type** - Indicates whether the link can be used only once or if it can be used multiple times.  
        - **authType** - Indicates whether the transaction is a sale or a pre-authorization.  
        - **paymentMethods** - Indicates the payment method that the merchant accepts.  
        - **charge** - Indicates whether the merchant or the customer enters the amount for the transaction.  
        - **status** - Indicates if the payment link is active.  

        For each payment link, we also return a paymentLinkId, which you can use for follow-on actions.

      description: |
        Use this method to partially update a payment link. Structure your request to follow the [RFC 6902](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) standard.

        To update a payment link, you need its paymentLinkId, which we sent you in the response of the [Create Payment Link](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/payment-links/create) method.  

        **Note:** If you don't have the paymentLinkId, use our [List Payment Links](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/payment-links/list) method to search for the payment link.  

        You can update the following properties of a multi-use link:
        - **expiresOn parameter** - Expiration date of the link.
        - **customLabels object** - Label for the payment button.
        - **credentialOnFile object** - Settings for saving the customer's payment details.

        You can update the following properties of a single-use link:
        - **expiresOn parameter** - Expiration date of the link.
        - **authType parameter** - Transaction type of the payment link.
        - **amount parameter** - Total amount of the transaction.
        - **currency parameter** - Currency of the transaction.
        - **description parameter** - Brief description of the transaction.
        - **customLabels object** - Label for the payment button.
        - **credentialOnFile object** - Settings for saving the customer's payment details.

        **Note:** When a merchant updates a single-use link, we update the payment URL and HTML code in the assets object. The customer can't use the original link to make a payment.

      description: |
        Use this method to return a [paginated](https://docs.payroc.com/api/pagination) list of sharing events for a payment link. A sharing event occurs when a merchant shares a payment link with a customer.  

        To list the sharing events for a payment link, you need its paymentLinkId. Our gateway returned the paymentLinkId in the response of the [Create Payment Link](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/payment-links/create) method.  

        **Note:** If you don't have the paymentLinkId, use our [List Payment Links](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/payment-links/list) method to search for the payment link.  

        Use query parameters to filter the list of results that we return, for example, to search for links sent to a specific customer.  

        Our gateway returns the following information for each sharing event in the list:  
        - Customer that the merchant sent the link to.  
        - Date that the merchant sent the link.

        Use this method to partially update a payment plan. Structure your request to follow the [RFC 6902](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) standard.  

        To update a payment plan, you need its paymentPlanId, which you sent in the request of the [Create Payment Plan](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/payment-plans/create) method.  

        **Note:** If you don't have the paymentPlanId, use our [List Payment Plans](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/payment-plans/list) method to search for the payment plan.  

        You can update all of the properties of the payment plan except for the paymentPlanId.  

        The value you sent for the onUpdate parameter when you created the payment plan indicates what happens to the associated subscriptions when you update the plan:  
        - `update` - Our gateway updates the subscriptions associated with the payment plan.
        - `continue` - Our  gateway doesn't update the subscriptions associated with the payment plan.

        Use this method to assign a customer to a payment plan.  

        **Note:** This method is part of our Repeat Payments feature. To help you understand how this method works with our Payment plans endpoints, go to [Repeat Payments](/guides/integrate/repeat-payments).  

        When you create a subscription you need to provide a unique subscriptionId that you use to run follow-on actions:  

        - [Retrieve Subscription](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/subscriptions/retrieve) - View the details of the subscription.
        - [Update Subscription](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/subscriptions/partially-update) - Update the details of the subscription.
        - [Deactivate Subscription](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/subscriptions/deactivate) - Stop taking payments for the subscription.
        - [Re-activate Subscription](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/subscriptions/reactivate) - Start taking payments again for the subscription.
        - [Pay Manual Subscription](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/subscriptions/pay) - Manually collect a payment for the subscription.

        The request includes the following settings:
        - **paymentPlanId** - Unique identifier of the payment plan that the merchant wants to use. If you don't have the paymentPlanId, use our [List Payment Plans](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/payment-plans/list) method to search for the payment plan.
        - **paymentMethod** - Object that contains information about the secure token, which represents the customer's card details or bank account details.
        - **startDate** - Date that you want to start to take payments.

        You can also update the settings that the subscription inherited from the payment plan, for example, you can change the amount for each payment. If you change the settings for the subscription, it doesn't change the settings in the payment plan that it's linked to.

        Use this method to manually collect a payment linked to a subscription. You can manually collect a payment only if the merchant chose not to let our gateway automatically collect each payment.  

        To manually collect a payment, you need the subscriptionId of the subscription that's linked to the payment. You sent the subscriptionId in the request of the [Create Subscription](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/subscriptions/create) method.  

        **Note:** If you don't have the subscriptionId, use our [List Subscriptions](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/subscriptions/list) method to search for the subscription.  

        The request includes an order object that contains information about the amount that you want to collect.  

        In the response, our gateway returns information about the payment and a paymentId. You can use the paymentId in follow-on actions with the [Payments](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments) endpoints or [Bank Transfer Payments](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/bank-transfer-payments) endpoints.

      summary: Create secure token
      description: |
        Use this method to create a secure token that represents a customer's payment details.  

        When you create a secure token, you need to generate and provide a secureTokenId that you use to run follow-on actions:  
        - [Retrieve Secure Token](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/secure-tokens/retrieve) – View the details of the secure token.  
        - [Delete Secure Token](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/secure-tokens/delete) – Delete the secure token.  
        - [Update Secure Token](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/secure-tokens/partially-update) – Update the details of the secure token.  
        - [Update Account Details](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/secure-tokens/update-account) – Update the secure token with the details from a single-use token.  

        **Note:** If you don't generate a secureTokenId to identify the token, our gateway generates a unique identifier and returns it in the response.  

        If the request is successful, our gateway returns a token that the merchant can use in transactions instead of the customer's sensitive payment details, for example, when they [run a sale](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/create).

        In the request, send the customer’s payment details. If the request is successful, our gateway returns a token that you can use in a follow-on action, for example, [run a sale](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/create).

      summary: Create Hosted Fields session
      description: |
        Use this method to create a Hosted Fields session token. You need to generate a new session token each time you load Hosted Fields on a webpage.  

        In your request, you need to indicate whether the merchant is using Hosted Fields to run a sale, save payment details, or update saved payment details.  

        In the response, our gateway returns the session token and the time that it expires. You need the session token when you configure the JavaScript for Hosted Fields.  

        For more information about adding Hosted Fields to a webpage, go to [Hosted Fields](https://docs.payroc.com/guides/integrate/hosted-fields).

        Use this method to return a [paginated](https://docs.payroc.com/api/pagination) list of payments. 

        **Note:** If you want to view a specific payment and you have its paymentId, use our [Retrieve Payment](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/retrieve) method.  

        Use query parameters to filter the list of results that we return, for example, to search for payments for a customer, a tip mode, or a date range.  

        Our gateway returns the following information about each payment in the list:  

        - Order details, including the transaction amount and when it was processed.  
        - Payment card details, including the masked card number, expiry date, and payment method. 
        - Cardholder details, including their contact information and shipping address. 
        - Payment details, including the payment type, status, and response. 
         
        For each transaction, we also return the paymentId and an optional secureTokenId, which you can use to perform follow-on actions.

      summary: Refund payment
      operationId: refundPayment
      description: |
        Use this method to refund a payment that is in a closed batch.  

        To refund a payment, you need its paymentId. Our gateway returned the paymentId in the response of the [Create Payment](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/create) method.  

        **Note:** If you don't have the paymentId, use our [List Payments](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/list) method to search for the payment.  

        If your refund is successful, our gateway returns the payment amount to the cardholder's account.  

        **Things to consider**  

        - If the merchant refunds a payment that is in an open batch, our gateway reverses the payment.
        - Some merchants can run unreferenced refunds, which means that they don't need a paymentId to return an amount to a customer. For more information about how to run an unreferenced refund, go to [Create Refund](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/refunds/create).

        Use this method to create an unreferenced refund. An unreferenced refund is a refund that isn't linked to a payment.  

        **Note:** If you have the paymentId of the payment you want to refund, use our [Refund Payment](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/refund) method. If you use our Refund Payment method, our gateway sends the refund amount to the customer's original payment method and links the refund to the payment.  

        In the request, you must provide the customer's payment details and the refund amount.  

        In the response, our gateway returns information about the refund and a refundId, which you need for the following methods:  

        - [Retrieve refund](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/refunds/retrieve) - View the details of the refund.  
        - [Adjust refund](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/refunds/adjust) - Update the details of the refund.  
        - [Reverse refund](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/refunds/reverse) - Cancel the refund if it's in an open batch.

        **Note:** If you want to view a specific refund and you have its refundId, use our [Retrieve Refund](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/refunds/retrieve) method.  

        Use query parameters to filter the list of results that we return, for example, to search for refunds for a customer, a tender type, or a date range.
        Our gateway returns the following information about each refund in the list:  
        - Order details, including the refund amount and when we processed the refund.
        - Payment card details, including the masked card number, expiry date, and payment method.
        - Cardholder details, including their contact information and shipping address.  

        For referenced refunds, our gateway also returns details about the payment that the refund is linked to.

      description: |
        Use this method to cancel a refund in an open batch.  

        To cancel a refund, you need its refundId. Our gateway returned the refundId in the response of the [Refund Payment](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/refund) or [Create Refund](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/refunds/create) method.  

        **Note:** If you don’t have the refundId, use our [List Refunds](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/refunds/list) method to search for the refund.  

        If your request is successful, the gateway removes the refund from the merchant’s open batch and no funds are returned to the cardholder’s account.

        Use this method to retrieve information about a debit card, a credit card, or an EBT card. If you apply surcharges to transactions, you can also check if the card supports surcharging.  

        In the response, our gateway returns the following information about the card:  

        - **Card details** - Information about the card, for example, the issuing bank and the masked card number.  

        - **Surcharging information** - If you apply a surcharge to transactions, our gateway checks that the card supports surcharging and returns information about the surcharge. For more information about surcharging, go to [Credit card surcharging](/knowledge/card-payments/credit-card-surcharging).

        - Currency conversion
      summary: Verify DCC eligibility
      description: |
        > **Important:** There are restrictions on which merchants can use this method. For more information, go to [Dynamic Currency Conversion](https://docs.payroc.com/knowledge/card-payments/dynamic-currency-conversion).  

        Use this method to check if a card is eligible for Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) and to retrieve the conversion rate for a transaction amount. DCC provides a customer with the option to use their card's currency instead of the merchant's currency, for example, in Ireland, an American customer can pay in US dollars instead of Euros.  

        The request includes the following:  

        - **Payment method** - Card information, a secure token, or digital wallet.  
        - **Transaction information** - Amount and currency of the transaction in the merchant's currency.  

        If the card is eligible for DCC, our gateway returns the transaction amount in the card's currency and a dccOffer object that contains information about the conversion rate. The dccOffer object contains the following fields that you need when you [run a sale](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/create) or [unreferenced refund](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/refunds/create) with DCC:

        Use this method to return a [paginated](https://docs.payroc.com/api/pagination) list of payments.  

        **Note:** If you want to view a specific payment and you have its paymentId, use our [Retrieve Payment](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/bank-transfer-payments/retrieve) method.  

        Use query parameters to filter the list of results that we return, for example, to search for payments for a customer, a date range, or a settlement state.  

        Our gateway returns the following information about each payment in the list:  

        - Order details, including the transaction amount and when it was processed.  
        - Bank account details, including the customer’s name and account number.  
        - Customer's details, including the customer’s phone number.  
        - Transaction details, including any refunds or re-presentments.  

        For each transaction, we also return the paymentId and an optional secureTokenId, which you can use to perform follow-on actions.

        Use this method to cancel a bank transfer payment in an open batch. This is also known as voiding a payment.  

        To cancel a bank transfer payment, you need its paymentId. Our gateway returned the paymentId in the response of the [Create Payment](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/bank-transfer-payments/create) method.  

        **Note:** If you don't have the paymentId, use our [List Payments](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/bank-transfer-payments/list) method to search for the bank transfer payment.  

        If your request is successful, our gateway removes the bank transfer payment from the merchant’s open batch and no funds are taken from the customer's bank account.

      summary: Refund payment
      description: |
        Use this method to refund a bank transfer payment that is in a closed batch.  

        To refund a bank transfer payment, you need its paymentId. Our gateway returned the paymentId in the response of the [Create Payment](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/bank-transfer-payments/create) method.  

        **Note:** If you don’t have the paymentId, use our [List Payments](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/bank-transfer-payments/list) method to search for the bank transfer payment.  

        If your refund is successful, our gateway returns the payment amount to the customer's account.  

        **Things to consider**  
        - If the merchant refunds a bank transfer payment that is in an open batch, our gateway reverses the bank transfer payment.  
        - Some merchants can run unreferenced refunds, which means that they don’t need a paymentId to return an amount to a customer. For more information about how to run an unreferenced refund, go to [Create Refund](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/bank-transfer-refunds/create).

        To cancel a refund, you need its refundId. Our gateway returned the refundId in the response of the [Refund Payment](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/bank-transfer-payments/refund) or [Create Refund](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/payments/bank-transfer-refunds/create) method.

        Use this method to board a merchant with Payroc.  

        **Note**: This method is part of our Boarding solution. To help you understand how this method works with other Boarding methods, go to [Board a Merchant](https://docs.payroc.com/guides/integrate/boarding).  

        In the request, include the following information:  
        - Legal information, including its legal name and address.  
        - Contact information, including the email address for the business.  
        - Processing account information, including the pricing model, owners, and contacts for the processing account.  

        When you send a successful request, we review the merchant's information. After we complete our review and approve the merchant, we assign:  
        - **merchantPlatformId** - Unique identifier for the merchant platform.  
        - **processingAccountId** - Unique identifier for each processing account linked to the merchant platform.  

        You need to keep these to perform follow-on actions, for example, you need the processingAccountId to [order terminals](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/processing-accounts/create-terminal-order) for the processing account.

      summary: List merchant platform's processing accounts
      description: |
        Use this method to retrieve a [paginated](https://docs.payroc.com/api/pagination) list of processing accounts linked to a merchant platform.  

        **Note**: If you want to view the details of a specific processing account and you have its processingAccountId, use our [Retrieve Processing Account](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/processing-accounts/retrieve) method.  

        Use the query parameters to filter the list of results that we return, for example, to search for only closed processing accounts.  

        To list the processing accounts for a merchant platform, you need its merchantPlatformId. If you don't have the merchantPlatformId, use our [List Merchant Platforms](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/list) method to search for the merchant platform.

        Our gateway returns the following information about eahc processing account in the list:  
        - Business details, including its status, time zone, and address.  
        - Owners' details, including their contact details.  
        - Funding, pricing, and processing information, including its pricing model and funding accounts.  

        For each processing account, we also return its processingAccountId, which you can use to perform follow-on actions.

      summary: Create processing account
      description: |
        Use this method to add an additional processing account to a merchant platform.  

        To add a processing account to a merchant platform, you need the merchantPlatformId. Our gateway returned the merchantPlatformId in the response of the [Create Merchant Platform](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/create) method.  

        **Note**: If you don't have the merchantPlatformId, use our [List Merchant Platforms](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/list) method to search for the merchant platform.  

        In the request, include the following information:  
        - Business details, including its business type, time zone, and address.  
        - Owners' details, including their contact details.  
        - Funding, pricing, and processing information, including its pricing model and funding accounts.  

        When you send a successful request, we review the information about the processing account. After we complete our review and approve the processing account, we assign a processingAccountId, which you need to perform follow-on actions.  

        **Note**: You can subscribe to our processingAccount.status.changed event to get notifications when we update the status of a processing account. For more information about how to subscribe to events, go to [Events List](https://docs.payroc.com/knowledge/events/events-list).

        Use this method to return a list of owners of a processing account.  

        **Note:** If you want to retrieve the details of a specific owner and you have the ownerId, go to our [Retrieve Owner](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/owners/retrieve) method.  

        To list the owners of a processing account, you need its processingAccountId. If you don't have the processingAccountId, use our [List Merchant Platform's Processing Accounts](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/list-processing-accounts) method to search for the processing account.  

        Our gateway returns the following information about each owner in the list: 

        - Name, date of birth, and address.  
        - Contact details, including their email address.  
        - Relationship to the business, including whether they are a control prong or authorized signatory, and their equity stake in the business.

      description: |
        Use this method to prompt a merchant to sign their pricing agreement.  

        You can create a reminder only if you requested the merchant’s signature by email when you created the processing account for the merchant.  

        To create a reminder, you need the processingAccountId. Our gateway returned the processingAccountId in the response of the [Create Merchant Platform](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/create) method or [Create Processing Account](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/create-processing-account) method. 

        **Note:** If you don’t know the processingAccountId, use our [List Merchant Platform’s Processing Accounts](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/list-processing-accounts) method to search for the processing account.  

        When you send a successful request, we send an email to the merchant that prompts them to sign their pricing agreement.

        **Note:** If you want to view a specific terminal order and you have its terminalOrderId, use our [Retrieve Terminal Order](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/terminal-orders/retrieve) method.  

        Use the query parameters to filter the list of results that we return, for example, to search for terminal orders by their status.  

        To list the terminal orders for a processing account, you need its processingAccountId. If you don't have the processingAccountId, use our [List Merchant Platforms](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/list) method to search for a merchant platform and its processing accounts.

        Our gateway returns the following information for each terminal order in the list:  

        - Status of the order  
        - Items in the order  
        - Training provider  
        - Shipping information  

        For each terminal order, we also return its terminalOrderId, which you can use to perform follow-on actions.

      description: |
        **Important:** You can retrieve a processing terminal only if the terminal order was created using the Payroc API.

        Use this method to retrieve information about a processing terminal.  

        To retrieve a processing terminal, you need its processingTerminalId. Our gateway returned the processingTerminalId in the response of the [Create Terminal Order](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/processing-accounts/create-terminal-order) method.  

        **Note:** If you don't have the processingTerminalId, use our [Retrieve Terminal Order](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/terminal-orders/retrieve) method or our [List Processing Terminals](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/processing-accounts/list-processing-terminals) method to search for the processing terminal.  

        Our gateway returns the following information about the processing terminal:  

        - Status indicating whether the terminal is active or inactive.  
        - Configuration settings, including gateway settings and application settings.  
        - Features, receipt settings, and security settings.  
        - Devices that use the processing terminal's configuration.

      description: |
        Use this method to retrieve a [paginated](https://docs.payroc.com/api/pagination) list of event subscriptions that are linked to your ISV account.  

        **Note:** If you want to view a specific event subscription and you have its id, use our [Retrieve Event Subscription](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/notifications/event-subscriptions/retrieve) method.  

        Use query parameters to filter the list of results that we return, for example, to search for subscriptions with a specific status or an event type.  

        Our gateway returns the following information about each subscription in the list:  
        - Event types that you have subscribed to.  
        - Whether you have enabled notifications for the subscription.  
        - How we contact you when an event occurs, including the endpoint that send notifications to.  
        - If there are any issues when we try to send you a notification, for example, if we can't contact your endpoint.  

        For each event subscription, we also return its id, which you can use to perform follow-on actions.
